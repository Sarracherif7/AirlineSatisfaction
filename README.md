## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict airline customer satisfaction based on various flight and service attributes. It tackles a *classification problem* using passenger data to categorize satisfaction levels.

The goal is to create a reliable and reproducible training and deployment pipeline following MLOps best practices, including version control, experiment tracking, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
